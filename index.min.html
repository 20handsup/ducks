Most migrate, though some stay in one place year-around. They are not all white, but a lot of them are. They swim around in ponds, lakes and other bodies of water. They paddle around and make <em>quacking</em> (kuh-WAK-in) noises. It's believed by some that this is the way that they communicate with each other. However, it's never been proven.</p><p>It's believed that ducks can really <em>boogie-down!</em> As a matter of fact, that is how the female ducks, or hens, choose a mate. By how well they dance. That and of course their appearance. Not unlike humans.</p><p>Ducks have webbed feet. This allows them to move through water. They just sort of paddle around. That's where we get the term <em>duck paddle</em> Ducks also have a bill (mouth appendage) that is flat and wide, as opposed to the beaks of other fowl.</p><p>Ducks sleep with one eye open. That's right. When they sleep, half their brain is asleep. The other half is awake and watching. This is why it is so hard to sneak-up on ducks. That's the thinking anyway.</p><figure><img src="./img/daffy-donald-duck.webP" alt="Donald & Daffy Duck"><figcaption>Daffy and Donald Duck</figcaption></figure><p>There is a famous cartoon duck named <em>Daffy.</em> He's black in color with a ring around his neck. Of course he has the usual yellow feet and bill. He has a <a href="#voice">funny voice</a>. Then there is <em>Donald Duck</em>, but really, he's just too much a cartoon. For one thing, he's depicted wearing a shirt and a hat. I think he's supposed to be a navy duck or something. And, I mean, <em>real</em> ducks don't wear clothes of any kind. Regardless, these are not the ducks we're concerned about here. We are really talking about real-live ducks.</p><p>Ducks are rather large for birds. And are favorites for hunters. Maybe because they are very large (easier to hit with a shotgun) and they are generally shot when attempting to lite (or land) on ponds or other bodies of water.</p><p>We here at DOPE (Ducks On Ponds Everywhere) believe that all ponds in our country should have ducks. It is our aim to see this come to fruition. After all, who among us doesn't enjoy watching ducks; they're fun! However, don't feed the ducks bread. When I was a kid, we used to go to the local park for purpose of feeding the ducks our old stale bread. Turns out, we learned later (much later) that ducks actually can get choked on bread. So, no more bread for the ducks.</p><p>The voice of Daffy Duck.</p><a name="voice"><audio src="assets/touchy.mp3" controls></audio></a></article><footer><p>Thanks for viewing.</p><p><i class="fa-brands fa-facebook"></i> <i class="fa-brands fa-linux"></i> <i class="fa-brands fa-square-git"></i></p></footer></body></html>
