      <h1>Ducks On Ponds Everywhere</h1>
        <p>
          Ducks are migratory waterfowl. Most migrate, though some stay in one
          place year-around. They are not all white, but a lot of them are. They
          swim around in ponds, lakes and other bodies of water. They paddle
          around and make <em>quacking</em> (kuh-WAK-in) noises. It's believed by
          some that this is the way that they communicate with each other.
          However, it's never been proven.

          It's believed that ducks can really <em>boogie-down!</em> As a matter of
          fact, that is how the female ducks, or hens, choose a mate. By how well
          they dance. That and of course their appearance. Not unlike humans.

          Ducks have webbed feet. This allows them to move through water. They
          just sort of paddle around. That's where we get the term
          <em>duck paddle</em> Ducks also have a bill (mouth appendage) that is
          flat and wide, as opposed to the beaks of other fowl.

          Ducks sleep with one eye open. That's right. When they sleep, half their
          brain is asleep. The other half is awake and watching. This is why it is
          so hard to sneak-up on ducks. That's the thinking anyway.

          There is a famous cartoon duck named <em>Daffy.</em> He's black in color
          with a ring around his neck. Of course he has the usual yellow feet and
          bill. He has a <a href="#voice">funny voice</a>. Then there is
          <em>Donald Duck</em>, but really, he's just too much a cartoon. For one
          thing, he's depicted wearing a shirt and a hat. I think he's supposed to
          be a navy duck or something. And, I mean, <em>real</em> ducks don't wear
          clothes of any kind. Regardless, these are not the ducks we're concerned
          about here. We are really talking about real-live ducks.

          Ducks are rather large for birds. And are favorites for hunters. Maybe
          because they are very large (easier to hit with a shotgun) and they are
          generally shot when attempting to lite (or land) on ponds or other
          bodies of water.

          We here at DOPE (Ducks On Ponds Everywhere) believe that all ponds in
          our country should have ducks. It is our aim to see this come to
          fruition. After all, who among us doesn't enjoy watching ducks; they're
          fun! However, don't feed the ducks bread. When I was a kid, we used to
          go to the local park for purpose of feeding the ducks our old stale
          bread. Turns out, we learned later (much later) that ducks actually can
          get choked on bread. So, no more bread for the ducks.
