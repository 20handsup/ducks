Ducks are migratory waterfowl.  They are not all white, but a lot of them are.  They swim around in ponds, lakes and other bodies of water. They paddle around and make _quacking_ (KUH-wak-in) noises.  It's believed by some that this is the way that they communicate with each other.  However, it's never been proven.

Ducks have webbed feet.  This allows them to move through water.  Duck also have a bill (mouth appendage) that is flat and wide, as opposed to the beaks of other fowl.

There is a famous cartoon duck named "Daffy."  He's black in color with a ring around his neck.  Of course he has the usual yellow feet and bill.  He has a funny voice.

Ducks are rather large for birds.  And are favorites for hunters.  Maybe because they are very large (easier to hit) and they are generally shot when attempting to lite (or land) on ponds or bodies of water.  

We believe that all ponds in our country should have ducks. They are fun to watch.
